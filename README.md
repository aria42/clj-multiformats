Clojure(Script) Multiformats
============================

This is a cross-compiled Clojure/CLJS library implementing the
[multiformats](https://github.com/multiformats/) standards which specify
self-describing value formats.

This includes support for:
- Unbounded [varint](https://github.com/multiformats/unsigned-varint) encoding.
- IPLD [CID](https://github.com/ipld/cid) content identifiers.


**WARNING:** This is still very much a work in progress. More to come!
